# Browser_History_Analysis_and_Search_Optimization_using_Logistic_Regression

**This project presents an in-depth analysis of web browsing history to enhance search optimization through logistic regression modeling. Leveraging browser history data extracted from a SQLite database, the study focuses on preprocessing steps including time conversion, feature engineering, and target variable generation. Exploratory data visualization techniques shed light on top visited domains, mean durations for popular URLs, and distribution of user interest categories. Correlation analysis informs feature selection and one-hot encoding for categorical variables. Logistic regression models, trained using stratified k-fold cross-validation and addressing class imbalance, undergo hyperparameter tuning via grid search for optimal performance. Results reveal insights into search behavior and model efficacy, with detailed performance metrics provided through classification reports and confusion matrices. This project underscores the potential of leveraging personal browsing history for enhancing search algorithms and user experience.**
